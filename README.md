Automated Exam Question Generator
Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop an automated exam question generator for educators. The system is designed to save time and effort in the preparation of objective assessment questions, such as multiple choice and true/false questions, fill in the blanks, match the following, and more. The system takes an instructional text as input and generates several fake phrases by replacing the true statement's core terminology with an antonym and by negating it. The true and false statements are randomly rearranged to create the test questions.
